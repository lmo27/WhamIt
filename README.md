# Wham It! - A wordle-based music game

## Rules:
- The user has 6 guesses to guess what movie the soundtrack is from. Each guess will have increasingly more time of the audio clip.
- If the movie name doesn't automatically pop up from the auto-fill then it will not be a possible answer.
- A guess will appear yellow if the date it was created is in the same decade as the answer. Red if it is a different decade.
**Note:** The source currently only uses one audio clip and does not rotate every day.
